## Series 1
1. audio models
2. check cpu variations with fixing arrival rate to 1 and high memory usage
### Outcome
1. CPU allocation has a linear trend on the model latency
2. Some heavy models are not working at all under some CPU allocation
3. Second run of the experiments has slightly better latency than the first one

## Series 2
1. resnet
2. checking all variables together which didin't work
3. should fixate on some variable and change only some of them
4. series one was done after two

## Series 3
1. resnet
2. check cpu variations
### Outcome
1. CPU allocation has a linear trend on the model latency
2. Some heavy models are not working at all under some CPU allocation
3. Second run of the experiments has slightly better latency than the first one

## Series 4
1. yolo
2. check cpu variations
### Outcome
1. CPU allocation has a linear trend on the model latency
2. Some heavy models are not working at all under some CPU allocation
3. Second run of the experiments has slightly better latency than the first one 

## Series 5
## Series 6
## Series 7
## Series 8
## Series 9
## Series 10
## Series 11
## Series 12

## Notes
1. what should I do for models that are not working at all in some experiments?
2. why second run is better?
3. for memory we need to find the "just enough memory" and no optimization after that makes real sense
